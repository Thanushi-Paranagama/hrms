## 🎯 Issues Fixed

- ✅ `event_detail.html` - View event details with participants
- ✅ `event_update.html` - Edit existing event

- ✅ `my_calendar.html` - Personal calendar view

**Files Created**: 6 new templates (1,500+ lines of HTML)

### 2. ✅ Employee List Filter Error (Previously Fixed)
**Problem**: Invalid Django template filter `regroup`
**Solution**: Changed to direct variable from view context
**Status**: Resolved

---

### 3. ✅ Attendance Dashboard Missing (Previously Fixed)
**Problem**: Template didn't exist
**Solution**: Created comprehensive dashboard with charts
**Status**: Resolved

---

### 4. ✅ URL Reverse Error (Previously Fixed)

**Solution**: Fixed URL references with proper parameters
**Status**: Resolved
